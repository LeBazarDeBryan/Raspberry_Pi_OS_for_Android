NAME
  systemctl - Translate systemctl invocations into real service commands
SYNOPSIS
  systemctl [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [SERVICE...]
DESCRIPTION
  Transform and execute every systemctl invocation into a single or multiple service and update-rc.d commands. This script attemps to replace systemctl from the systemd project, for applications that are hardcoded errantly to use systemctl instead of real service control operations.

  The goal is to convert all possible systemctl tasks to real service commands.

  The script will log all invocations to /var/log/systemctl.log to assist in troubleshooting.
