Source: David Frey, the first packager said: "I took the program off
        Infomagic's Usenet CD-ROM (1994)".
Comment: the upstream said:
         "This is a PD version of the SYS V banner program (at least I think
          it is compatible to SYS V) which I wrote to use with the clock
          program written by:
               DCF, Inc.
               14623 North 49th Place
               Scottsdale, AZ 85254
          and published in the net comp.sources.misc newsgroup in early July
          since the BSD banner program works quite differently."
